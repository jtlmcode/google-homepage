The Odin Project - Google homepage mini project

This is a mini-project that is going to teach me how to position objects on a page, and really going to get me used to making adjustments in HTML and CSS again. 

This is the first project, and will be really difficult but it's going to be rewarding to see at the end and hopefully will be the catalyst for a lot more to come. 

Be kind to yourself, because you are learning and you need time for this to settle in, but mostly, have fun and work hard! See you on the other side!  05/01/2021
